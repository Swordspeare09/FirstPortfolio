# FirstPortfolio
This my first web portfolio ever made.

I created this using Bootstrap 4 and very few JavaScript knowledge. The pages and pictures are all responsive with mobile and desktop modes. I also attached my personal GitHub and linkedIn pages. 

The nav bar at the top collapses and transfroms into a burger widget for smaller screens. 

The footer is stuck to the bottom of every page and condenses for mobile views.

The design is basic but I will build upon all these pages as I grow.
